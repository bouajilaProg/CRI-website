# Coding Conventions

To make the use of this project easier for future developers, please adhere to the following rules:

## TypeScript Naming Conventions

- Use **camelCase** for variable names.
  - **Examples:** `helloWorld`, `itemPrice`, `fooValue`

## Clarity in Naming

- The names of variables, branches, and commits should be **clear and insightful**.

### Bad Examples:
- `iPrice`
- `a`
- `new nav`

### Good Examples:
- `itemPrice`
- `fooValue`
- `added a new nav in the fooPage`

## Type Naming Convention

- Types should be named in the following format:
  - `t_typeName`

## Comments

- Try to add comments before every function (optional but it helps a lot : ) )

## Class and Component Naming Conventions

- Class and component names should use **PascalCase**.
  - **Examples:** `MainObject`, `GreatThings`

By following these conventions, we can ensure better readability and maintainability of the codebase.
